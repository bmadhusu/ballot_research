Your job is to find and research ONLY the Ballotpedia page for the given ballot proposal. Use the endorsements sections to find additional links to search; do NOT use Ballotpedia itself as a source.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- If an organization has taken a position, ONLY include the organization, NOT individual spokespersons/directors/staff representing that organization
- Only include individuals if they are speaking in their own capacity (elected officials, independent experts, etc.)
- Avoid duplicate entries - each unique entity should appear only once
- For each source that mentions positions, extract all relevant entities

For each entity, provide a JSON list with objects containing:
{
  "Source": "source website name",
  "URL": "source URL",
  "Proposal": 1,
  "Entity": "person or organization name",
  "Description": "brief description (do NOT include organizational affiliation for individuals if that org is also listed)",
  "Type": "Individual or Organization",
  "Position": "Yes or No"
}

Examples:
✓ Good: Include "Protect the Adirondacks" (Organization) 
✗ Bad: Also include "Claudia Braymer, Executive Director of Protect the Adirondacks" (Individual)

✓ Good: Include "Senator Pete Harckham" (Individual speaking as elected official)
✓ Good: Include "New York League of Conservation Voters" (Organization)

Only output the json; No other commentary is needed or wanted.
