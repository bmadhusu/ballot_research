    Proposition 2 is:
Fast Track Affordable Housing**
    This proposal sought to expedite the approval process for certain affordable housing projects. It introduced two new fast-track public processes, aiming to reduce the seven-month Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) for publicly financed affordable housing projects and those in districts with lower rates of affordable housing development. A "yes" vote would fast-track these projects, while a "no" vote would maintain the longer review process with City Council input. This proposal passed. The League of Women Voters of the City of New York supported a "yes" vote, emphasizing the need for an adequate supply of affordable housing. However, some concerns were raised regarding the affordability metrics and the potential to reduce City Council's role.
