    Proposition 4 is:
Establish an Affordable Housing Appeals Board**
    This proposal intended to create an Affordable Housing Appeals Board with representation from the Mayor, City Council Speaker, and the relevant Borough President. This board would have the power to reverse City Council decisions on affordable housing projects with a two-to-one vote, replacing the current mayoral veto. The City Council strongly opposed this, viewing it as undermining their authority and the principle of member deference. This proposal passed.
