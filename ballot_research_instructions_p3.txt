    Proposition 3 is:
Simplify Review of Modest Housing and Infrastructure Projects**
    This measure aimed to create an Expedited Land Use Review Procedure (ELURP) for smaller land use projects, such as modest increases in housing capacity or infrastructure improvements. This ELURP would shorten the review time from the current seven-month ULURP process. The City Council opposed this proposal, arguing it would eliminate their final review power and the ability of communities to negotiate benefits. This proposal passed.
