    Proposition 6 is:
Move Local Elections to Presidential Election Years
    This proposal aimed to shift New York City's primary and general elections from odd-numbered years to align with federal presidential election years (even-numbered years). Proponents argued this would significantly increase voter turnout, citing significantly higher participation in presidential elections compared to off-year city elections. The Independent Budget Office estimated potential savings of $42 million every other year if this reform were implemented. However, this proposal did not pass. For this proposal to take full effect, a statewide constitutional amendment would also be required.
